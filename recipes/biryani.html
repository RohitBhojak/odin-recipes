    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish that originated in the Indian subcontinent, likely dating back to
        the Mughal Empire. It is a beloved dish known for its rich blend of spices, tender meat or vegetables, and
        fragrant long-grain basmati rice. Biryani is popular not only in India but also in various parts of South Asia
        and the Middle East, each region adding its own unique twist to the recipe.</p>

    <p>The dish typically consists of marinated meat (commonly chicken, lamb, goat, or beef) or vegetables, layered
        with partially cooked rice, and then slow-cooked to perfection. The key to a good biryani lies in the marination
        of the meat, the quality of spices, and the cooking technique, which allows the flavors to meld together
        beautifully.</p>
