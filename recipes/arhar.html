    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Arhar dal is a type of lentil that is split and skinned, resulting in a pale yellow color. It has a mild, nutty
        flavor and a creamy texture when cooked. This dal is a staple ingredient in Indian cooking and is used in a
        variety of dishes, from soups and stews to main courses.</p>

    <p>Nutritionally, Arhar dal is a rich source of protein, making it an important component of vegetarian and vegan
        diets. It also provides essential nutrients such as dietary fiber, folate, iron, potassium, and magnesium. Due
        to its high protein content, Arhar dal is often combined with grains like rice to form a complete protein
        source.</p>
