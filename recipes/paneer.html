    <h2>Description:</h2>

    <p>Paneer Tikka Masala is a popular Indian dish consisting of marinated and grilled paneer (cottage cheese) cubes
        cooked in a rich and flavorful tomato-based gravy. It is a vegetarian variation of the classic chicken tikka
        masala.</p>

    <p>The dish typically begins with marinating paneer cubes in a mixture of yogurt and spices such as turmeric, red
        chili powder, and garam masala. The marinated paneer is then skewered and grilled until it develops a slightly
        charred exterior, imparting a smoky flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>250g paneer (cottage cheese), cubed</li>
        <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, pureed</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 green chili, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro (coriander) leaves for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Marinate paneer cubes in yogurt, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least
            30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C (390°F). Thread the marinated paneer cubes onto skewers and place them on a baking
            tray. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the paneer is slightly charred.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add minced garlic, grated ginger, and chopped green chili. Sauté for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now, add tomato puree and cook until the oil separates from the masala.</li>
        <li>Add coriander powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and garam masala. Mix well and cook for 2-3
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Add water to adjust the consistency of the gravy and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the gravy reaches the desired consistency, add the baked paneer tikka cubes. Mix gently to coat the
            paneer with the masala.</li>
        <li>Simmer for another 5 minutes. Adjust seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and serve hot with naan or rice.</li>
